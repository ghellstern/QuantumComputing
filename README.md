# QuantumComputing with Qiskit

Using Quantum Computing with Qiskit for Machine Learning:

-- In one notebook the results of "An artificial neuron implemented on an actual quantum processor" by Francesco Tacchino, Chiara Macchiavello, Dario Gerace and Daniele Bajoniare is reproduced

-- The paper is furthermore extended for a simple pattern recognition example.

-- For linear separable data even a one qubit classifier can be built in a very simple way
